# How to run:
Project has been tested on Python 3.6 but should
work on anything 3.4 and up.

```

Additional simulation configs can be defined as needed.

You can create new simulation configurations with any
number of cars.  For imformation on which args you need,
I recommend that you read the source and see examples
